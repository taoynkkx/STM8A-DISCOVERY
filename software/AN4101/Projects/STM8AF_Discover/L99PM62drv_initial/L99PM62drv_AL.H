/*! @fn         void SPI_Send (uint8 *DataTX, uint8 *DataRX)
    @param[in]  DataTX  defines pointer to 3 byte data to be transmitted via SPI
    @param[out] DataRX  defines pointer to 3 byte data to be received via SPI
    @brief 
Generally the function should be included from some low level SPI driver. 
If such direct compatible function does not exist, the function should be
created in L9952drv_AL.c file. 
Number of transmitted data via SPI: 3 bytes (24bit). 
Data order for transmitting: First is send the first byte, than the second and
than the third one. MSB is always transmitted as the first bit from the byte
via SPI. Data order for received data is the same as for transmitted. 
This function is originally implemented as dummy function in L9952drv_AL.c file.

Assigns function which replaces general function name L9952DRV_AL_SPI_WR

assumed that exists function SPI_Send() to provide this SPI communication. 
Generally function SPI_Send() should be included from some low level SPI
driver. If such direct compatible function does not exist, the SPI_Send()
function should be created in L9952drv_AL.c file. */
